      <p>The design behind Mirobot encourages learning at a range of different levels. It's built to teach you about everything from basic electronics to algorithms using LOGO and web programming using Javascript.</p>

  <section id="blocks" class="pullout odd">

      <h3>Web based programming using blocks</h3>
      <p>Using a Scratch-like visual programming language, children can easily program Mirobot from the browser without having to worry about getting code syntax right.</p>

      <h3>Javascript programming</h3>
      <p>Because Mirobot can be controlled over a WebSocket connection, it means it's very easy to use Javascript to tell it what to do. Either control it from a script embedded in a web page or use Node.js to control it. You can also use the awesome Cylon.js project to program it.</p>

    <div class="inner">
      <img class="right" src="/assets/pullout/prog_logo.png" />
      <h3>LOGO programming directly</h3>
      <p>With more than a passing hat-tip to the original Turtle robots, Mirobot can be programmed using LOGO for a simple no fuss language that children can easily understand.</p>

  <section id=" arduino" class="pullout even">
    <div class="inner">
      <img class="left" src="/assets/pullout/os_firmware.png" />
      <h3>Arduino programming</h3>
      <p>Because Mirobot is based around an Arduino compatible core, the regular Arduino IDE can be used to modify the firmware. There are several sketches included to get things started but it is designed to be reprogrammed</p>
