    <h2><a href="/blog/2013/11/27/arduinobot-is-now-mirobot/">Arduinobot is now Mirobot</a></h2>
    <p><p>The project is still very much alive. After a hiatus of almost two years it&#39;s great to be posting something here again.</p>

<p>The first news is that I&#39;ve changed the name of the project. Arduinobot was a bad name because it piggy-backed on the Arduino brand (which is a bad thing to do) so I&#39;ve renamed it to Mirobot. There are a few things behind the name but essentially it came from thinking about what an artistic drawing robot might be called. It&#39;s named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Mir%C3%B3">Joan Mir√≥</a>, the 20th Century Spanish artist.</p>

<p>Since I left Xively I&#39;ve been dedicating several days a week to completing the first version of Mirobot. This was the main reason for the hiatus - it was too difficult to do work on hardware without a good workshop. Setting up on the kitchen table is far from ideal so now I&#39;ve got a proper workshop (with room for a laser cutter :-) I&#39;ve made much better progress. Some of the things I&#39;ve done in the last couple of months are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Re-worked the drive train to use direct-drive geared steppers. This massively simplifies the mechanical design as well as being even lower cost</li>
<li>Designed a custom circuit board that fits nicely in the robot and that&#39;s very low cost to build. It&#39;s all through-hole so it can be easily soldered. More on that later.</li>
<li>Set up a WiFi module so it&#39;s completely wireless and networkable.</li>
<li>Written a couple of Arduino libraries;

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bjpirt/HotStepper">HotStepper</a> is a lightweight interrupt driven stepper motor driver</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bjpirt/LogoVM">LogoVM</a> is a customisable virtual machine that runs the LOGO language for telling it what to do</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The aims of the project are unchanged; create a low cost, fully open source drawing robot that can be used to teach children about technology and programming.</p>

<p>There are lots of plans for building the supporting parts of the project like the documentation and instructions as well as a web site where people can learn, but more about those in the future. I&#39;m going to be selling Mirobots as kits to try and get lots out into the world. <a href="/sign_up">Sign up to the mailing list</a> if you&#39;d like to be notified when they are available.</p>
