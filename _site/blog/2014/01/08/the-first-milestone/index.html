    <h2><a href="/blog/2014/01/08/the-first-milestone/">The First Milestone</a></h2>
    <p><p>The main reason I started designing Mirobot was to be able to build it with my kids so Christmas seemed like the perfect opportunity to do this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/milestone/kids.jpg" alt="The kids with their robots" title="The kids with their robots"></p>

<p>The things you learn from doing real user testing are fantastic. They both assembled the chassis and managed to solder the circuit board mostly by themselves. Obviously there was a lot of adult supervision but they both seemed to really enjoy the process of actually building something for Christmas, not just getting it out of a box. The easier it is to build, the more likely people are to use it and recommend it to others, so I&#39;ll be designing out some of the points of friction I we came across to make it easier to build. Audrey is keen to do some more soldering on the next version. The learning points were:</p>

<ul>
<li>The WiFi module was a bit wobbly on the connector I was using. Not sure if this actually caused any issues but I didn&#39;t like it</li>
<li>Some of the smaller pads on the PCB were difficult to solder. They managed fine with all of the larger pads, so I&#39;m going to make them all this size</li>
<li>It was quite easy to short between the pads and the solder resisted ground plane so I&#39;m going to increase the separation between them</li>
<li>The reception of the WiFi module using the built-in antenna was not too great - might need to provide it with an external antenna</li>
<li>The servo for the pen arm wasn&#39;t very well aligned. Need to check the measurements to see if one of the cutting holes has been shifted slightly</li>
<li>The fact that the chassis construction is symmetrical means that the servo can be placed at either side. This was intentional but I think it only confuses things because you&#39;d have to use slightly different firmware</li>
<li>It needs a status indicator so you can see that it&#39;s happy. At the moment there&#39;s a basic power LED, but I think I&#39;m going to drive this from the Arduino so that you can also tell whether the WiFi is connected and the program is running happily</li>
<li>The PCB is hard to debug once you&#39;ve built the whole thing. This is the same for any PCB really, but I think if I write the instructions so that you check it as you go along it will be much easier to isolate where the short might be</li>
<li>Pressing the reset button for the Arduino should also reset the WIFi module - I&#39;ll need to bring this line out through the connector to the module</li>
<li>The small pegs were fiddly and it was hard to tell which way round they should go - I can make them a bit bigger so there&#39;s more to grab on to and they are more obvious</li>
<li>The wheel attachment is a bit loose and needs tightening a bit more</li>
<li>The battery holder feels a bit loose as it&#39;s just resting there between the steppers and the PCB. I&#39;d like this to feel a bit more solid</li>
</ul>

<p>However, fundamentally, the robot worked - they were able to assemble and solder it themselves and then we were able to make it draw some patterns which they thought was &quot;awesome&quot; and &quot;epic&quot;. I was a little concerned before Christmas about how they would handle the soldering, but they did a great job.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>

<p>I&#39;m going to revise things based on this list of improvements and make the whole thing a bit more stable then I&#39;ve got some ideas for some cool projects to show off its capabilities, particularly around the fact that it&#39;s internet accessible. Once I&#39;ve done that I think it&#39;s probably time to start thinking about Kickstarting it to see if anyone else wants one. I&#39;d love to get it into some schools so that more kids can get some experience building and programming it.
