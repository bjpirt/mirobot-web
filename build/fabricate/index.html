      <h3>Get the chassis laser cut</h3>
      <p>The chassis can be laser cut from a single sheet of 3mm MDF. You can find the designs for it <a href="https://github.com/bjpirt/mirobot-chassis">on GitHub</a>. If you've already got your own laser cutter then you should be good to go. If you haven't then you can send it somewhere like <a href="http://www.razorlab.co.uk/">Razor Lab</a> and they'll cut it for you.</p>

      <h3>Get the PCB made</h3>
      <p>There are currently two PCBs used for Mirobot; the main PCB and the WiFi module. These can both be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/bjpirt/mirobot-pcb">from GitHub</a>. Check the <a href="https://github.com/bjpirt/mirobot-pcb/releases">releases</a> and download the latest. You can use the Gerber files in this release to send somewhere like <a href="http://www.ragworm.eu/">Ragworm</a> and they'll send you back your PCBs</p>

      <h3>Buy the parts</h3>
      <p>You'll need some parts to make Mirobot work. They've been chosen to be quite low cost so shouldn't break the bank. Apart from the electronics, you'll need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 x 28BYJ-48 stepper motors. These can be picked up pretty easily <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=28BYJ-48">on eBay</a>. Make sure you get the ones with a 1:64 gear ratio</li>
        <li>1 x <a href="http://www.pololu.com/product/174">Pololu caster wheel</a>.</li>
        <li>1 x <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=9g+servo">9g Micro Servo</a>. I've successfully used the ones from Tower Pro, but they should all work I think</li>
        <li>1 x <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=5+AA+Battery+Holder">5 AA Battery holder</a></li>
        <li>2 x Elastic Bands</li>
        <li>2 x M3 x 16 machine screws</li>
      </ul>
