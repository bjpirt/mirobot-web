I thought I'd have a quick competition to celebrate the fact that the latest version of Mirobot is now shipping and that you can get 15% off this Cyber Monday (use the code CYBER2015 at checkout)

One lucky winner will get a customised Mirobot, which means you get to design the artwork that gets laser etched on the side of Mirobot (where the logo is) so you end up with a completely unique robot. I'll make sure it's etched and shipped in time for Christmas. Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Retweet this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Get 15% off Mirobot, the WiFi drawing robot for kids <a href="https://t.co/DbmRMnn6KT">https://t.co/DbmRMnn6KT</a> code: CYBER2015 /RT &amp; follow to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/win?src=hash">#win</a> <a href="https://t.co/sxAViRUkmL">pic.twitter.com/sxAViRUkmL</a></p>&mdash; Mirobot (@mirobot_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/mirobot_io/status/671084421030744064">November 29, 2015</a></blockquote>
