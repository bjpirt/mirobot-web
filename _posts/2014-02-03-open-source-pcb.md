In the previous post I open sourced the chassis designs and this time it's the turn of the PCB.

The PCBs are designed in [Eagle CAD](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/eagle-pcb-design-software/product-overview/?language=en) and you can download the schematics and board designs from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/bjpirt/mirobot-pcb) if you want to modify or improve them. Alternatively, I've also packaged up the Gerber files for this first public release [here](https://github.com/bjpirt/mirobot-pcb/releases/tag/v1.4). You can send these off to somewhere like [Ragworm](http://ragworm.eu) to get them made.
