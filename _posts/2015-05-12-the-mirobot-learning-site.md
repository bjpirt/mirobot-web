I've always made a big effort to make sure that the instructions for building Mirobot were clear and the "build" section of the site contains everything you need to be able to get Mirobot up and running. One thing I've always struggled with a little is where to put all of the other content like tutorials, lesson plans and challenges that make Mirobot more fun to use.

I just launched the [Mirobot Learning Site](http://learn.mirobot.io) which makes it a lot easier to create new content to help people use Mirobot in new and interesting ways.

You can filter by skill level and document type to find the content you're looking for. I'll be adding to the tutorials on an ongoing basis, but [get in touch](/contact/) if you have any good ideas for things you'd like to see up there.
