      <p>Mirobot has been designed to be easy to assemble with minimal tools required. After assembling it, children will be more engaged in using it and have more of a sense of achievement</p>

      <h3>Self-assembly Chassis</h3>
      <p>Mirobot is laser-cut from a single small piece of MDF and can be assembled in a matter of minutes. There is only one screw and everything pegs together.</p>

      <h3>Make your own from scratch</h3>
      <p>If you're feeling like going through the entire process, you can download the PCB files and get them made and laser cut the chassis to really build everything yourself.</p>

      <h3>Easily modified</h3>
      <p>It's easy to add in things like extra sensors and actuators because the chassis is made from MDF and the PCB exposes extra pins just in case. Mirobot is a first step - the next are up to you.</p>
